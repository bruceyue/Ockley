This is a simple web based editor for Force.com Apex and Visualforce. It aspires to be the textpad/notepad of Force.com development tools.

What currently works (not a lot)

* You can login to a Salesforce Org (tested with Developer and Enterprise Editions).
* It will retrieve your Apex code and Visualforce pages
* basic apex/vf syntax highlighting
* You can edit and save Apex and Visualforce.
* You can deploy it to Heroku!
