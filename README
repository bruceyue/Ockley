This is a simple web based editor for Force.com Apex and Visualforce. It aspires to be the textpad/notepad of Force.com development tools.

What currently works (not a lot)

* You can login to a Salesforce Org (tested with Developer and Enterprise Editions).
* It will retrieve your Apex code and Visualforce pages
* basic apex/vf syntax highlighting
* You can edit and save Apex and Visualforce.
* You can create New Apex Classes and Visualforce pages.
* It will warn you if you attempt to overwrite something that is newer than what you are editing
* It is jQuery theme-enabled
* You can deploy it to Heroku!

Setup

The instructions here will get you started in Node: http://dailyjs.com/2010/11/08/node-tutorial-2/

* Install Node.js - http://nodejs.org/
* Install npm - https://github.com/isaacs/npm
* Install a bunch of modules.
    cd Ockley
    npm install express mustache mustachio sax

* Run the build script [ Work in progress ]
    cd Ockley/build
    ant build

* Run Ockley
    cd Ockley
    node app.js


Code Notes

The app is built using express.js and the template engine is mustache.

The js files in the root are the core of the node app.
app.js - is the app (of course)
sfdc.js - routines for interacting with salesforce via REST or SOAP.
utils.js - is pretty self-explanatory

In views, layout.mustache is the "master template" and the other templates are injected into it.
Mustachio is used to set the template params for things like stylesheets and scripts.
The mustachio files are named similar to the template but have a js suffix.

In public, we have standard web stuff.
Any javascript that I wrote is under public/js.
Javascript libraries that I didn't write, live under public/libs.
